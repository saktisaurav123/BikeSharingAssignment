# Linear Regression Bike Sharing 
> Requirement is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
Bikes were shared for 2 years i.e. 2018 and 2019 and teh data is collected having various features such as temperature, weather etc. Help to predict the bike demand when inputs are available. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

- What is the dataset that is being used?
BoomBikes Bike Sharing Dataset


## Conclusions
- There are many categorical values in the dataset and hence need to clean the data accordingly.
- Customers prefer Summer and pleasant temperature for bike booking
- Increase of sales in 2019 compared to 2018
- It seems that customers prefered Summer and Winter season. 
- Customer avoid during Misty and rainy weather and preferred clear and cloudy weather
- Customer tend to use bikes less on holidays and more on working days
